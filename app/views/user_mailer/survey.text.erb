Hello <%= @user.name.split(" ")[0] %>,

I wonder if you would mind doing me a favor? My co-founder, Kristian and I are trying to figure out whether we are doing the right things with our startup, Wishlistt. 

You signed up <%= time_ago_in_words(@user.created_at) %> ago and have had some time to play with the site since then. If itâ€™s not too much to ask we would really appreciate if you would take around 2-8 minutes of your time to answer the survey below about your experience with Wishlistt:

All the best,

Daniel Friis, Wishlistt

PS. Feel free to write me an email if you would rather provide your feedback through there.
