Hello <%= @user.name.split(" ")[0] %>,

I wonder if you would mind doing me a favor? My co-founder Kristian and I are trying to figure out whether we are doing the right things with our startup, Wishlistt. We really want to give you the best experience possible, such that Wishlistt eventually means as much to you as it does to us.

You signed up <%= time_ago_in_words(@user.created_at) %> ago and have had some time to play with the site since then. If itâ€™s not too much to ask we would really appreciate if you would take around 2-8 minutes of your time to answer the survey below about your experience with Wishlistt:

Again, your feedback would really mean the world to us.


All the best,

Daniel Friis, 
Founder of Wishlistt

PS. Feel free to write me an email if you would rather provide your feedback through there or if you have any questions what so ever.
